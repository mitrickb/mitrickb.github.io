                <p style="text-align: center">Sir Timothy Berners-Lee is the inventor of what you are on right now, the World Wide Web. Berners-Lee initiated the creation of Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)  and HTML (HyperText Markup Language), both of which are used as the backbone of the World Wide Web. He created these with simplicity in mind, so that, down the line, anyone could add their own webpage to the World Wide Web. Without his inventions, it’s unlikely that you would be able to read this webpage now or even access a page like Google.</p>

                <p style="text-align: center;">Dr. Barbara Liskov is a computer scientist and professor at the Massachusets Institute of Technology. Not only is she the creator of the Liskov substitution principle, a principle used for replacing objects with subtypes, but Liskov was also the first woman to earn a doctorate in computer science in the United States. Liskov helped pave the way for women in the computer science workforce and in computer science education.</p>

                <p style="text-align: center;">Hedy Lamarr was not your average computer scientist. In fact, she wasn’t even a computer scientist by trade at all. Instead, she was a famous actor in Czechoslovakia and the United States. However, during World War 2, she created a radio guidance system for torpedos in order to avoid the jamming sequences of the Axis Powers. This system used a constantly changing frequency, known as frequency-hopping, to guide the torpedos rather than a single, constant frequency. This technology would then go on to be used in modern-day signals like Bluetooth and RFID. </p>

                <p style="text-align: center;">You may not know who Larry Page is but you certainly know his invention. In 1998, alongside co-founder Sergey Brin, Page founded a search engine known as Google. This website utilized tools called web crawlers to, as their name implies, crawl across the World Wide Web and measure the importance and contents of a webpage. These web crawlers allowed Google to find the best results possible for a given search. Google is now the most visited website in the world with its subsidiary Youtube being a distant second.</p>

The co-founder and former president of Microsoft, Gates is responsible for the creation of Windows, MS-DOS, Altair BASIC, and a wide variety of other computer operating systems. Now, Gates is retired and currently chairs the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the world’s wealthiest charitable foundation, and has donated over $28 billion to charities, many of which focus on the advancement of the field of computer science.</p>

                <p style="text-align: center;">Rear Admiral Grace M. Hopper was not only an amazing member of the Navy but also an extremely influential programmer and computer scientist. During her time in the military, Rear Admiral Hopper became one of the first programmers of the Mark 1 computer, one of the world’s first general-purpose computers. Rear Admiral Hopper would then go on to develop UNIVAC, the first general-purpose computer for businesses, and COBOL, a programming language that was very similar to English instead of machine code. For her service to America, in both the military and for the American public, Rear Admiral Hopper was awarded the Defense Distinguished Service Award.</p>
